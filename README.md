# News-Sentiment-Analysis
A program that retrieves relevant news articles and returns a sentiment analysis.
I Originally set out to create a news scan that could find news that could effect short term stock prices. Because I am working on another project to 
analyze companies financial statements I thought it would be good to change it to a search for news articles related to a specific stock. The current script I have in this repository retrieves relevant 
news aritcles and analyzes them using spacy and textblob's natural language processing into sentiment values. Then visualize these sentiment values using matplotlib.
